ROBLOX Username: icepuddle0

Introduction

Hello, you can call me icepuddle. Scripting (and programming in general) has been a passion of mine for many years, and I am an aspiring game developer. I'm 15, if you were wondering. I have an affinity for projects involving data stores, but I am always striving to gain a wider variety of skills.

I've been scripting on roblox for 2 years now and been a fan of Roblox for the past 5 years; experienced within the community

Finished Projects

This section of the portfolio will detail my completed projects, in chronological order.

Infinite Ice Rink
This is the first project that I have ever published and advertised. Players explore the ice rink, interacting with the unique physics and collecting valuables. They can also purchase double speed and a vip rank.
It includes:
A complex algorithm for creating an ever-transforming play area
Data saving so players can come back later
A leaderboard to spark competition
Gamepasses and in-game prompts

DemoTower
DemoTower is the second project I have ever published and is one of my favorites. Everyone works together to destroy objects in the center arena and gain points from it. Powerful rocket launchers spawn occasionally across the walkways, but only have a limited number of uses. Players can purchase a more powerful starting launcher and a vip rank.
It includes:
Explosions! (explosions are cool)
Data saving
A variety of objects to shoot

Item System Test
This project was created for a commission but eventually became redundant, so I published the prototype anyway. The project demonstrates the skeleton of a ‘Find the..’ game, with scaling in mind. There is not much to do, but creating it was a valuable experience.

Airdrop
Airdrop is the first ever game produced by my new group, Gold Shore Studios. Players navigate the terrain, collecting parcels dropped by airplanes. No gamepasses (or developer products) are currently available.
